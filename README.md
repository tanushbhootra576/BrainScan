## About the Project

BrainScan is an advanced medical imaging analysis system that leverages deep learning to assist in the detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. Developed by [Tanush Bhootra](https://github.com/tanushbhootra576) and [Raksh](https://github.com/raksh), this project aims to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool for preliminary tumor analysis.

### Key Highlights
-  Medical-grade classification system
-  State-of-the-art deep learning model
-  Modern web interface for easy access
-  Detailed analysis and reporting
-  Privacy-focused design

The system can analyze MRI scans and classify them into four distinct categories:
- ðŸ”´ Glioma
- ðŸŸ¡ Meningioma
- ðŸŸ¢ No tumor
- ðŸ”µ Pituitary

##  Features

- **Advanced Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes transfer learning with VGG16 architecture
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Detects four types of brain conditions with high accuracy
- **Modern Web Interface**: Built with React and Vite for a smooth user experience
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant classification results with confidence scores
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices

##  Technical Architecture

### Backend Model Architecture
- Pre-trained VGG16 network as feature extractor
- Custom classification layers:
  - Flatten layer
  - Dropout (30%)
  - Dense layer (256 neurons, ReLU)
  - Dropout (20%)
  - Softmax output (4 classes)

### Frontend Architecture
- React 18 with Vite for fast development
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- RESTful API integration
- Real-time image processing and display

##  Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv brain_tumor_env
   .\brain_tumor_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```powershell
   cd brain-tumor-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

### Training the Model

Run the training script:
```powershell
python brain_tumor_classification.py
```

The script will:
- Load and preprocess the brain MRI images
- Display sample images from the training set
- Train the model using transfer learning with VGG16
- Save the trained model as 'brain_tumor_model.h5'
- Evaluate the model on the test set

##  Model Performance

The model achieves approximately 80% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating strong performance in medical image classification. Performance metrics include:

- Accuracy: ~80%
- Precision: ~78%
- Recall: ~76%
- F1-Score: ~77%

##  Usage Examples

### API Endpoint Usage
```python
import requests

url = 'http://localhost:5000/predict'
files = {'image': open('mri_scan.jpg', 'rb')}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)
prediction = response.json()
```

### Web Interface
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Upload Image" or drag and drop an MRI scan
3. View the classification results and confidence scores
4. Export or save the results as needed

## Important Notes

- This model is intended for research and educational purposes only
- Always consult healthcare professionals for medical diagnoses
- Model performance may vary with different MRI equipment and scan qualities
- Regular model updates and retraining are recommended for optimal performance
